I think the user methods are fine at this point, I still need to perfect the post / comment relationship

the repo router still needs more work, it need more error handling as well as more functionality






User model:

{
  // id obviously makes sense as a unique identifier
  _id: String,
  // since profiles are unique and tied to the user it makes sense to have a reference in the user object
  profileId: String,
  // all authentication properties are necessary to handle different login types
  googlePermissions: {
    authenticated: {type: Boolean, default: false},
    password: {type: String, default: null}
  },
  facebookPermissions: {
    authenticated: {type: Boolean, default: false},
    password: {type: String, default: null}
  },
  twitterPermissions: {
    authenticated: {type: Boolean, default: false},
    password: {type: String, default: null}
  },
  // having an email as a unique identifier as well as for verification purposes makes sense
  // although I'm wondering if creating an auth property with an object containing both an email
  // as well as a phone linked to the account
  email: {type: String, required: true, unique: true},
  // the rest is fine, pretty self explanatory
  authenticated: {type: Boolean, default: false},
  password: {type: String, default: null},
  findHash: {type: String, unique: true}

  // any additions?:

  perhaps a created_at field?
}

Profile model:

{
  // pretty simple model, but I think as the app becomes more complex more can be added to this in terms of customization
  _id: String,
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String,
  userName: String
}

Message model:

{

}
