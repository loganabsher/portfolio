# Logan Absher's Portfolio

a react.js web app listing my accomplishments as a coder.

Note: this is still in development, I am the only contributor so it may move slowly

Yes, I am very aware that it is stupid to have a login page for a portfolio, but it is more of a showcase of my skills and I had a lot of fun working with the authentication for my web app. I'm planning to add a guest user account so if anyone visits and can't be bothered to make a fake account they can just push a link to skip all that nonsense.
